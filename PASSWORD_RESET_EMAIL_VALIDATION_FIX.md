## ✅ Password Reset Email Validation Fix

### What Was Changed:

**Before:**
- Entering any email (registered or not) would show "Reset code sent successfully"
- This was misleading because unregistered emails couldn't actually reset passwords

**After:**
- Only **registered emails** can initiate password reset
- **Unregistered emails** get a clear error message: *"No account found with this email address. Please check your email or create a new account."*

### Changes Made:

1. **Backend (authentication/views.py)**:
   ```python
   # Old code (misleading):
   except User.DoesNotExist:
       return Response({'message': 'If this email exists, a reset code will be sent'}, status=status.HTTP_200_OK)
   
   # New code (clear error):
   except User.DoesNotExist:
       return Response({
           'error': 'No account found with this email address. Please check your email or create a new account.'
       }, status=status.HTTP_404_NOT_FOUND)
   ```

2. **Frontend**: Already properly handles 404 errors and displays the error message in a red alert box.

### How to Test:

1. **Start both servers** (if not already running):
   ```bash
   # Backend
   cd backend
   python manage.py runserver
   
   # Frontend  
   cd frontend
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Test with unregistered email**:
   - Go to http://localhost:5174/admin/login
   - Click "Forgot Password?"
   - Enter an email that doesn't exist (e.g., `test@nonexistent.com`)
   - Click "Send Reset Code"
   - **Result**: Should show red error message: "No account found with this email address..."

3. **Test with registered email**:
   - First create an account through the registration page
   - Then try password reset with that registered email
   - **Result**: Should show success message and generate reset code

### Security Benefits:
- ✅ Clear user feedback
- ✅ Prevents confusion about whether email was sent
- ✅ Guides users to register if they don't have an account
- ✅ Still maintains security (no sensitive data exposed)

### Development Mode:
- For testing, the response includes the generated code in the API response
- Remove the `'code': reset_code.code` line from the response in production
