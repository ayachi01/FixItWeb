# Password Reset Issues - FIXED

## Issues Identified and Resolved

### 1. Frontend API Response Handling Issue
**Problem**: The `ResetPasswordForm` component was not properly checking the API response success status. It was treating any non-error response as successful, even when the API returned `success: false`.

**Root Cause**: The `authService.resetPassword()` method returns an `ApiResponse` object with a `success` property, but the component was only checking for thrown exceptions, not the response status.

**Solution**: Updated the ResetPasswordForm component to properly check `response.success` before marking the operation as successful.

**Fixed Code**:
```typescript
// Before (incorrect)
try {
  await authService.resetPassword(email, code, password);
  setSuccess(true); // Always set success if no exception thrown
  setTimeout(() => onSuccess(), 2000);
} catch (err) {
  setError(err instanceof Error ? err.message : 'Failed to reset password');
}

// After (correct)
try {
  const response = await authService.resetPassword(email, code, password);
  
  if (response.success) {
    setSuccess(true);
    setTimeout(() => onSuccess(), 2000);
  } else {
    setError(response.message || 'Failed to reset password');
  }
} catch (err) {
  setError(err instanceof Error ? err.message : 'Failed to reset password');
}
```

### 2. Frontend OTP Verification Parameter Mismatch
**Problem**: The `VerifyOtp` component was calling `verifyOtp(email, code)` with separate parameters, but the hook expected a single `VerifyOtpRequest` object.

**Solution**: Updated the component to pass the correct object structure:
```typescript
// Before
await verifyOtp(email, code);

// After
await verifyOtp({ email, otp: code });
```

### 3. Missing Resend Functionality
**Problem**: The resend button wasn't actually generating a new code - it was just resetting the UI.

**Solution**: Updated the resend handler to actually call the forgot password API again:
```typescript
const handleResend = async () => {
  if (canResend) {
    setTimer(60);
    setCanResend(false);
    setOtp(['', '', '', '', '', '']);
    resetState();
    
    // Actually resend the OTP by calling the forgot password API again
    try {
      await authService.forgotPassword({ email });
    } catch (error) {
      console.error('Failed to resend OTP:', error);
    }
    
    onResendOtp();
    inputRefs.current[0]?.focus();
  }
};
```

### 4. Professional HTML Email Template Added
**Enhancement**: Created a modern, responsive HTML email template with:
- Clean header with gradient background
- Prominently displayed verification code
- Professional styling with inline CSS for email client compatibility
- Security tips and footer
- Both HTML and plain text versions for maximum compatibility

## Test Results
✅ Complete password reset flow tested and working
✅ Old password correctly rejected after reset
✅ New password successfully accepted
✅ Resend functionality working
✅ Professional email template implemented

## Files Modified
1. `frontend/src/features/auth/components/ResetPasswordForm.tsx` - Fixed API response handling
2. `frontend/src/features/auth/components/VerifyOtp.tsx` - Fixed parameter passing and resend functionality
