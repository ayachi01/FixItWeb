# Password Reset "Invalid or Expired Code" Issue - FIXED

## Root Causes Identified and Fixed

### 1. Critical Bug in `is_expired()` Method 🐛
**Problem**: The `PasswordResetCode.is_expired()` method was using `.seconds` instead of `.total_seconds()` on a timedelta object.

**Impact**: Codes were being marked as expired almost immediately after being created, because `.seconds` only returns the seconds component (0-59) of a timedelta, not the total duration.

**Fix**:
```python
# Before (BROKEN)
def is_expired(self):
    expiry_time = getattr(settings, 'OTP_EXPIRY_TIME', 600)  # 10 minutes
    return (timezone.now() - self.created_at).seconds > expiry_time

# After (FIXED)
def is_expired(self):
    expiry_time = getattr(settings, 'OTP_EXPIRY_TIME', 600)  # 10 minutes  
    return (timezone.now() - self.created_at).total_seconds() > expiry_time
```

### 2. Hardcoded Verification Code in Frontend 🔒
**Problem**: The `ForgotPasswordPage.tsx` was using a hardcoded verification code `'123456'` instead of the actual verified code from the OTP verification step.

**Impact**: The ResetPasswordView was receiving the wrong code, causing "Invalid or expired code" errors.

**Fix**:
1. **Updated VerifyOtp component** to capture and return the verified code:
```typescript
interface VerifyOtpProps {
  email: string;
  onSuccess: (verifiedCode: string) => void;  // Now passes the code
  onBack: () => void;
  onResendOtp: () => void;
}
```

2. **Updated ForgotPasswordPage** to use the actual verified code:
```typescript
// Before (BROKEN)
const handleOtpSuccess = () => {
  setVerificationCode('123456');  // Hardcoded!
  setCurrentStep('reset-password');
};

// After (FIXED)
const handleOtpSuccess = (verifiedCode: string) => {
  setVerificationCode(verifiedCode);  // Use actual verified code
  setCurrentStep('reset-password');
};
```

### 3. Frontend API Response Handling Issue (Previously Fixed)
**Problem**: The ResetPasswordForm wasn't properly checking API response success status.

**Status**: ✅ Already fixed in previous iteration

## Test Results After Fixes
